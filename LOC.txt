reproduce.ml is used to convert strings into emojis. As it matches well over 1000 (~1400) emojis, each on their own line, we did not count that towards our LOC in make loc although it could probably be considered for 100-200 equivalent of code given that we had to check individual emojis to see if the package was updated or not, which took about 8 hours. We included everything else in .ml and .mli files since nothing else was dead code or trivial or brute force.
