Installation Instructions:

  - To install the required packages, run `make install`
  - We have included `opam update` and `opam upgrade` inside the make install because we require the user to install the most recent Emoji package. 


Build Instructions:

  - To build the system, run `make build`. After, run `make oscar`.
  - To run the system, run `make run`
  - On a new tab on terminal, under the same folder, run `make connect`. Make sure you give the server at least 5-10 seconds to start up before connecting. If not, it will possibly reject the client connection. If that occurs, just try connecting again.
  - You can have as many client tabs opened interacting with each other as you want. If not, follow "Connecting from other computers" below to communicate between different computers. 
  - For testing, run `make test`. If it doesn't work, run `make clean` first.
  - There also exists a `make docs` to extract HTML.
  - If folder is very messy, run `make clean`.


Connecting from other computers:
    - Although we do not have an internet connection setup, we would like to suggest you still trying to communicate between different computers using SSH. 
    - On one computer, this will be where the local server is hosted, run `make run` to start the server.
    - On a new tab on terminal, type `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (to find your IP address if you are connected to a wireless network) or `ipconfig getifaddr en1` (if you are connected to an Ethernet).
    - This will provide the laptop's IP address for the other computers to SSH into. 
    - To connect to the main computer, on another laptop, open terminal
    - Then, input `ssh <username>@<IP address>`, where the username is for the server computer. 
    - For example, Oscar's username for his computer is OscarSo and his IP is 168.23.55.77. (This is fake, don't try it) 
    - Therefore, Tushar, on his computer terminal, would type `ssh OscarSo@168.23.55.77`.
    - Input any prompts that the terminal tells you, including the password of the computer you are ssh-ing into if necessary. After successfully ssh-ing into the server computer, locate the directory in where our project is.
    - Then, type `make run` on your own terminal. Communication would work even when apart. 


Process:
  - For the client:
    - Input name, you will get ID
    - Input password, make it short and simple, it will be for sending messages and verifying you are the user sending the message.
    - If you are a previous user, it will prompt you if you want to sign in as the same person. If you type `yes`, then type your previous password, you will be logged back in as the same old user. 
    - To get all the messages from the buffer, type `read`. 
    - To get the most recent message in the buffer, type `recent`.
    - To send messages to the buffer, type `[id]: send [msg]`, where [id] is your ID number and [msg] is the message you want to send. Some examples are below.
      - For example, if your ID is 1, you can send a message like so: `1: hello!` 
    - To send an emoji to the buffer, type `[id]: emoji [emoji_name]`, where [id] is your ID number and [emoji_name] is the name of the emoji.
      - For example, if your ID is 1, you can send a grinning face emoji as `1: emoji grinning_face`.
    - To see a list of emojis that you can use type `emojis`.
    - When you send an ascii emoji, it will be converted to a real emoji.
      - For example, `1: send :)` has the same result as typing `1: emoji smiling_face`
    - To quit the client, just cmd+w (mac) or ctrl+w (windows) and terminate the client. 
    - To quit server if needed, just ctrl+c on the terminal itself. 

Note: Some emojis are really new and the OCaml emoji files and my matching code don't include them. They will be replaced with a red question mark. 

This file now includes backend encryption. It won't be noticeable in the UI, but the code generates a key from encryption.ml and utilizes it to encrypt the message which is saved in a mutable variable for list of lists so that the middle man will not understand anything even if they access the variable. Then, when read/recent is called, it decrypts the message again. 

To view how encryption works:
    - Run `make`, this will open uTop for you. 
    Code along: 
    #use "encryption.ml";;
    let m,k,ki = generate_keys();;
    let message = 69;;
    let encrypted = m k message;;
    let decrypted = decrypt m ki encrypted;;
    This will show decrypted message from the encryption which should be the same as the initial number.
    - Since we used ASCII for each char, this encryption method will work for us.
